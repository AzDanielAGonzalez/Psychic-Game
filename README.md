# Psychic-Game
This is my first ever attempt at creating a Javascript game. Although I struggled a bit down the way, I succefully made a functioning game in the end. I watched numerous video tutorials, and visted many web developer websites. They really did help me get a good understanding for how my code was working. I struggled with making the game work without caps lock being turned on. I tried many lines of code, but I was not able to make it work. I wish I had more time to make it look pretty with bootstrap/css, but a lot of the hours of this project went into understanding for loops, variables, and scope. I am proud of the progress I have made learning how to javascript, I plan on returning to this game in the future to further build upon it.
